We have a beginners tutorial! [see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g49gfMtzETY)

## Font Image
Scuffedwalls uses a special image to get the font for text to wall conversion. The image consists of a black or transparent background with the all characters on the same line.

example

individual characters must be seperated by at least one vertical line of uninterupted black/transparent pixels.  (i.e just keep the characters apart)

the characters are read in the order 
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
questionmark period exclamation apostrophe

if you generate and all the text is the wrong character, check your font.png file! there is probably character overlap.
