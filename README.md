# ScuffedWalls
A simple tool for making NE 2.0 beat saber maps easier. (Heavilly inspired off of BeatWalls)

Features:
 - Noodle extensions custom json data
 - Simple 3d model to wall support with animation & color
 - Image to wall support w/ compression
 - Custom events support
 - Importing map objects from other map files
 - Appending custom data to map objects

- ~~Text to wall support~~ v0.8.0 probably
 
 Usage:
  - Drag the map folder onto the program
  - Input the number of the map file to generate to (Will overwrite anything in this map file)
  - Type in the generated SW file, saving refreshes the program automatically. Or hitting R in the console window.
Windows will probably bother you about this being malware. If you dont trust it clone the repo and build it yourself.
