# ScuffedWalls
A command line tool for making NE 2.0 beat saber maps & modcharts. It provides an alternative to direct scripting and comes with some extra features which can aid in creation like Model, Image, and Text to wall converters.

Features:
 - No code
 - Create custom events
 - Import/combine map objects from other map files
 - Append custom data to map objects
 - Simple 3d model to wall with animation & color
 - Image to wall w/ compression
 - Text to wall
 
 Usage:
  - Drag the map folder onto the program
  - Input the number of the map file to generate to (Will overwrite anything in this map file)
  - Input y/n for Autoimport (avoids complete overwrite)
  - Input y/n for Backup (creates backups of map and SW file)
  - Type in the generated SW file, saving refreshes the program automatically. Or hitting R in the console window.
  
*Windows will probably bother you about this being malware. If you dont trust it clone the repo and build it yourself.*
