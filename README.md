# ScuffedWalls
A tool for making NE 2.0 beat saber maps & modcharts. It provides an alternative to direct scripting and allows for a more user friendly and stable approach to creating mod maps. It also comes with some extra features which can aid in creation like Model, Image, and Text to wall converters.

Features:
 - Can parse all Noodle Extensions custom json data
 - Can create custom events.
 - Can import/combine map objects from other map files
 - Can append custom data to map objects
 - Allows for a stable and quick workflow
 - Simple 3d model to wall support with animation & color
 - Image to wall support w/ compression
 - Text to wall support
 
 Usage:
  - Drag the map folder onto the program
  - Input the number of the map file to generate to (Will overwrite anything in this map file)
  - Input y/n for Autoimport (avoids complete overwrite)
  - Input y/n for Backup (creates backups of map and SW file)
  - Type in the generated SW file, saving refreshes the program automatically. Or hitting R in the console window.
  
*Windows will probably bother you about this being malware. If you dont trust it clone the repo and build it yourself.*
